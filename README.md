**Proximity Matching Algorithm:**
```python
def find_matching_donors(request):
    # Step 1: Filter by blood group compatibility
    compatible_blood_groups = get_compatible_groups(request.blood_group)
    
    # Step 2: Filter active donors (not in rest period)
    eligible_donors = filter_active_donors(compatible_blood_groups)
    
    # Step 3: Calculate proximity in expanding circles
    radius_levels = [5, 10, 20, 30]  # kilometers
    
    for radius in radius_levels:
        nearby_donors = calculate_proximity(
            request.hospital_location, 
            eligible_donors, 
            radius
        )
        
        if len(nearby_donors) >= MIN_DONOR_THRESHOLD:
            return prioritize_donors(nearby_donors)
    
    # Step 4: Return best available if not enough found
    return prioritize_donors(nearby_donors)

def prioritize_donors(donors):
    return sorted(donors, key=lambda d: (
        d.distance_km,           # Proximity first
        -d.last_active_timestamp, # Recent activity
        d.response_history_rate   # Reliability score
    ))
```

**Notification Delivery Strategy:**
```python
def send_notifications(request, donors):
    # Batch 1: Send to closest 5 donors immediately
    immediate_donors = donors[:5]
    send_immediate_notifications(request, immediate_donors)
    
    # Batch 2: Send to next 10 donors after 3 minutes if no response
    schedule_delayed_notification(request, donors[5:15], delay=180)
    
    # Batch 3: Expand search radius after 10 minutes
    if not has_sufficient_responses(request, 600):
        expand_search_radius(request)
```

### 6.3 Security & Privacy Implementation

**Data Encryption Standards:**

    notification_frequency ENUM('all', 'critical', 'none') DEFAULT 'critical',
    social_sharing_allowed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Access Control Matrix:**
| Role | Donor PII | Location | Medical Data | Contact Info |
|------|-----------|----------|--------------|--------------|
| Donor (Self) | Read/Write | Read/Write | Read/Write | Read/Write |
| Requester | None | Area Only | Blood Group | On Accept Only |
